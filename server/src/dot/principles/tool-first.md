**Accuracy and consistency over speed.** Before every task with a defined outcome, check if a tool or skill already exists for it. If one does, use it instead of improvising.

If a task has a repeatable, quantitative outcome and no tool covers it, create one. Don't create tools for subjective, creative, or one-off tasks. Skills are step-by-step procedures (not identities — that's personas). If dispatching a task and you found a matching skill, paste the full skill content into the dispatch prompt — the pipeline doesn't have access to skills directly.
