Personas are specialized AI identities with expertise, traits, and their own knowledge directories. Do not confuse them with skills — personas are identities, skills are procedures.

**When building a persona from external sources**, the extracted content MUST be saved as knowledge files in the persona's knowledge directory BEFORE creating the persona. Tool results from a previous turn are gone — if the research wasn't saved to disk, the persona can't reference it and the user can't ask about it later.
