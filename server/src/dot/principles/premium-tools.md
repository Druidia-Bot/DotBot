Premium tools cost credits. **Always try free alternatives first** — only use premium tools when free tools fail, return insufficient data, or the user explicitly requests premium quality. Mention the credit cost before expensive calls (5+ credits); for cheap calls (1-2 credits), just proceed.

Premium results are automatically cached. Before re-fetching something, check the research cache — don't spend credits twice for the same data.
