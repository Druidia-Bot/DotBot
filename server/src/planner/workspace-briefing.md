## Your Workspace

Your workspace is at `|* Workspace Path *|`. Everything you need is here or can be fetched and saved here.

### Current Contents
```
|* Workspace Files *|
```

### Data Protocol
1. **Check workspace FIRST** — before fetching any external data, check if it's already in your workspace (use `directory.list` or `filesystem.read_file`)
2. **Save external data** — when you fetch data from the web, APIs, email, or any external source, save it to `|* Workspace Path *|/research/` with a descriptive filename (e.g. `competitor-analysis.md`, `weather-api-response.json`)
3. **Save deliverables** — final outputs go in `|* Workspace Path *|/output/`
4. **Read intake files** — `intake_knowledge.md` contains gathered context about the task (memory, files, web search results, polymarket). Read this if you need background.
